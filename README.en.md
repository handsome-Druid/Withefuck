# Withefuck

[English](./README.en.md) | [中文](./README.md)

Inspired by [nvbn/thefuck](https://github.com/nvbn/thefuck), Withefuck leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to fix mistyped shell commands automatically. No rule sets to maintain, supports multi-round corrections with recent context.

- Advantage 1: No manual rule maintenance
- Advantage 2: Uses multiple recent commands to infer your real intent

Supports bash, zsh and fish for now.
